<p class="lead">We Provide Back End Services</p>
<p>
	We provide a range of <a href="/powerups/">web services</a> (we call them powerups) your game can
	integrate with, along with dashboards to configure them. The services
	are generic and flexible to suit as many games possible, while
	maintaining a great ease-of-use. So get back to developing a kick ass
	game and let us handle the servers.
</p>

<p class="lead">Mix and Match</p>
<p>
    Choose only the powerups your game needs. By giving you the ability to pay
    for only what you want, we hope to make your operating costs lower than
    what you might get with other services on the market.

<p class="lead">Painless Integration</p>
<p>
	We&rsquo;ve done the hard work of integrating with your game engine so that you don&rsquo;t have to.
	<a href="#">Download our library</a> and you&rsquo;ll be up and running in minutes.
	Currently we support the Unity game engine, with support for additional engines coming soon.
	<a href="/contact/">Let us know</a> what game engine library you&rsquo;d like to see.
</p>

<p class="lead">Consolidated Billing</p>
<p>
	Receive one monthly bill for the services you use, for all your games.
	Nice.
