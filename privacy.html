<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy outlines all aspects of what data Lumos may receive about you and how, and your rights regarding that collection. Lumos will never sell, rent, trade or license, in whole-part or piecemeal, any information that we hold about or relating to you, gathered through intent or passively, to any third party and that access to your information within Lumos will be restricted and accessible only where necessary to the function for which it was collected.<p>

<h3 class="spacer">Data Handling Principles</h3>

<p>Lumos collects data&hellip;</p>

<ul>
	<li>For the effective provision of its services;</li>
	<li>To ensure the integrity of its systems and the safety of its employees;</li>
	<li>To prevent unauthorized access to and abuse of Lumos&rsquo; resources and data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lumos does not&hellip;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cross-reference or collate passed and passive data to generate &ldquo;user profiles&rdquo;;</li>
	<li>Seek any more information except than that which is absolutely necessary for the desired function to be carried out.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="spacer">Data We Collect</h3>

<p>Passed data is information about yourself that you actively and wilfully pass to us by explicitly engaging with active functions of the Lumos site, such as writing to us through our contact form or signing up. Any passed information relating to a person or organisation other than your own self that Lumos can reasonably assume that entity would find it disagreeable for Lumos to hold shall have that information removed from Lumos&rsquo; systems as soon as possible.<p>

<p>Passive data covers all data that we receive about you through your casual engagement with Lumos, including: the type of device you are accessing the site through; your browser; and your connection speed; in some cases, this information may be collected in conjunction with external resources (see &ldquo;Related policies&rdquo;).</p>

<h3 class="spacer">Data Security</h3>

<p>Lumos take all reasonable physical and digital precautions to ensure the integrity of your data against modification, disclosure or destruction, at least as carefully as it would for its own data. Should any unauthorized access occur, accidentally or otherwise, Lumos will seek to immediately notify any concerned parties and advise them of remedial action.<p>

<p>Lumos enforces strict data handling and management practices among all its employees, and has guidelines on disciplinary action up to contract termination and criminal prosecution.</p>

<h3 class="spacer">Your Rights</h3>

<p>You can, at any time, request that Lumos permanently erase any and all personal and identifiable information directly related to your person or company at any time, and Lumos will endeavour to adhere to this request as quickly as possible and notify you of its completion.<p>

<h3 class="spacer">Changes</h3>

<p>Lumos may, from time to time, change the wording or features of this policy; though Lumos shall not debase its fundamental tenants as described in the &ldquo;Summary&rdquo;. Lumos shall retain online and make available an accessible archive of previous policies when an update occurs. Further, Lumos shall endeavour to take reasonable action towards notifying users of any changes.<p>
