		<h5>Mission</h5>
		<p>
		    We want to make the lives of game developers easier.
		    Building backends for games is no walk in the park, and we believe that the job should be handled by folks like us while you focus on making the next chart topper.
		</p>

		<h5>History</h5>
		<p>
		    We started with the goal of making a drop dead simple analytics system so that game developers can see what&rsquo;s going on in their games.
		    From there we realized that analytics is only a small piece of the larger puzzle, and that a comprehensive platform for multiple web services would be valuable for studios.
		</p>
		<p>
		    As of January 1st, 2016, Lumos was put into read-only mode and stopped accepting new users and games.
		    The company now focuses exclusively on game development.
